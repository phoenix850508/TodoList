# TodoList with React

TodoList is the first React todo I built based on the ACs material, using JSX syntax and follows the React coding style to create reusable UI components.

## Install the project

1. Ensure already installed `node.js`
2. Clone the project
3. Enter the project folder. And install npm `npm install`
4. Start the project `npm start`
5. To exit, press `ctl + c`
